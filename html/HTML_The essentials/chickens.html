    <h1>Chicken</h1>

    <br />
    The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round
    short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia
    around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat
    and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

    <br />

    <p>
      Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total
      population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more
      than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per
      year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore,
      religion, and literature.

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the
      legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[17] Wild
      junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to
      allow them to fly more than a short distance.[18] Size and coloration vary
      widely between breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy
      crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin
      on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are
      more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra
      feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[19]
